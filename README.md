﻿# Welcome to TT_WIZARD_CORE!

This projects provides an operating system independent backend to download and manage *.gme-files / audio files for the TipToi pen sold by Ravensburger. By removing the hassle to deal with file versioning and download servers, it especially enables the creation of tools for operating systems that are currently not officially supported by the manufacturer itself (like Linux). **TT_WIZARD_CORE** only uses the official servers (i.e. hosted by the manufacturer) to download any media files! 

## Following operations are currently supported:
- Searching the names of all currently published TipToi media for a keyword (e.g. "puzzle" to get all puzzles listed).
- Picking and downloading selected media from the search results above.
- Checking whether an already downloaded media file needs an update or not.
- Auto update of media files that are already loaded to the TipToi pen
- Auto detect of pen mount point (tests ongoing)

## Planned features
- Update dependencies: Test / expand compatability with older versions

print("Welcome to an example of TT_WIZARD_CORE!")

# Create an tt_wizard_core object and try to auto dectect pen
# A list of all available media files is downloaded automatically.
ttwiz = tt_wizard_core()
if ttwiz.autoDetectPenMountPoint() is False:
    # If pen is not detected automatically, set mount point manually.
    print("What is the path to your TipToi pen?")
    ttwiz.setPenMountPoint(str(input()))

# Provide a string to search in the list of available media. 
print("Please enter keyword to search avaiable media for: ")
keyword = str(input())

# Search for string and receive a python list of media titles that partially match.
print("Found following media:")
searchResult = ttwiz.searchEntry(keyword)
num = 0
for item in searchResult:
    print(str(num) + ": " + item)
    num = num + 1

# Decide on which one to download and download media to folder specified in first step.
print("Which one do you like to download?")
chosenNum = int(input())
titleAsList = [searchResult[chosenNum]]
ttwiz.downloadMedia(titleAsList) #searchResult[chosenNum] is "<<fileName>>.gme"

# Do you want to download all available files?
#allMediaFilesList = ttwiz.getAllAvailableTitles()
#ttwiz.downloadMedia(allMediaFilesList)

# Pass the file name to retrieve information on whether an update is suggested or not.
#print("Update? " + str(ttwiz.checkForUpdate(searchResult[chosenNum], penPath))) # when >>penPath<< is different from the one configured in the constructor
print("Update? " + str(ttwiz.checkForUpdate(searchResult[chosenNum])))

# Perform automatic update on already downloaded media files.
print("Files updated: " + str(ttwiz.performAutoUpdate(dryRun=True)))
```
